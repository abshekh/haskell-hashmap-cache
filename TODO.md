- meaningfull names?
- haven't looked into atomic insert, updates and lookups. should be simple with takeMVar/tryTakeMVar
- TTL should be just for table values or value reference as well
    - value reference would be better/easier to implement
    - if ttl is associated to table values, then in case of [table values], different rows may have different ttls
